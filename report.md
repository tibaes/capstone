## Definition

In biometrics there are two main operations: verification (1:1) and identification (1:N). Verification is the process that confirms a person's identity based on their biometrics. Identification is the process to identify a person's identity based on its biometrics, i.e. searching the correspondent biometric model in the database. A naive identification algorithm would perform the verification procedure for each person's biometric model stored in the database. To reduce the computational costs, a clever approach would compute indexes for each biometric model in the database. With a properly indexed database, the identification process would require to perform the verification algorithm only in a reduced subset of the database.

There are a couple of biometrics modalities capable to accurately identify an individual, such as the face, fingerprint and iris. In this work we focus on fingerprints accquired by imaging sensors. Fingerprints are composed by ridges (darker pixels) and valleys (lighter pixels), where each fingerprint has an unique composition of ridges and valleys. Despite the unique composition, all fingerprints follow one of the five fundamental types, i.e. ridge patterns, described by _NIST_ [2]: i) Arch, ii) Left Loop, iii) Right Loop, iv) Tented Arch, and v) Whorl. If we could compute the fundamental type of every fingerprint, this information could be used to perform the database indexation. Using just this indexation we would be able to perform the identification task (1:N) almost five times faster!

I am particularly interested in this problem because I need a solution for a complex newborn fingerprint identification platform that I'm working on. In a real world application it would be easy to have a huge database, which would take a very long time to compute a naive identification algorithm. Proprietary technology is capable to achieve a high speed identification feedback, however they are not suitable for our needs.

Inspired by the Udacity _dog breed_ assignment, and also by the work of Kai et Al. [1], which uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify the pattern of small fingerprint patches, targeting forensics applications,  in this work we trained a network to compute the most basic fingerprint indexation: the ridge pattern. This is a multi-class classification problem, with well established metrics for accuracy. Given a database of labeled fingerprint images, containing the fundamental type information, the algorithm should give the same answer as the database labels.
